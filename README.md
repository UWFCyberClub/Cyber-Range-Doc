### UWF CyberNauts CyberRange Documentation

This is work in progress documenation.  
For updates, see Michael.

#### Current status:  
The club has acquired it's own servers. Currently the plans are to run 
both servers as ProxMox CE virtualization servers. We are waiting on
deployment of the first of the two before continuing work. The second
server is slated for finalization and deployment by the end of
Fall semester 2018. 

> Current server administration is overseen by both Thomas Thibaut and Michael Mitchell. See them for more details or questions.
